# OhelmX

Charts and helper scripts for installing Open edX and dependencies, and setting up a `k3d`-based development environment.

See `charts` and particularly `ok3dx` for more details and installation instructions.

This is still early alpha software, so great care should be taken installing it, particularly if you are not already familiar with both Open edX and `k3d`/`helm`.
